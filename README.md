# 🍽️ Food Delivery Time Prediction

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project predicts the estimated delivery time of food orders based on various factors like traffic conditions, weather, delivery person's age, vehicle type, and distance. The goal is to optimize delivery operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Web interface for user-friendly predictions (Planned with Flask)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- **Web Framework (Future Integration):** Flask 🌐

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple attributes, including:
- **Type_of_vehicle** (Motorcycle, Scooter, Electric Scooter)
- **Delivery_person_Age** (20 to 45 years)
- **City** (Metropolitan, Urban, Semi-Urban)
- **Weather Conditions** (Fog, Cloudy, Stormy, Windy, Sandstorms, Sunny)
- **Type_of_order** (Snack, Meal, Drinks, Buffet)
- **Road_traffic_density** (High, Low, Medium, Jam)
- **Festival Effect** (Yes, No)
- **Time of Day** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- **Other Factors:** Delivery person's ratings, vehicle condition, multiple deliveries, order readiness, and distance in km

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Visualizing trends and correlations
- Identifying factors affecting delivery time

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models are implemented and evaluated:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **XGBoost**
5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

The models are evaluated based on RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.

## 🏆 Results & Insights
- Key factors influencing delivery time are identified.
- The most accurate model is selected for future deployment.
- Businesses can use these insights to optimize delivery efficiency.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Deploying the model using Flask with an HTML interface 🌐
- Incorporating real-time traffic and weather data
- Implementing deep learning models for better accuracy
